# EasyPEFTGUI

Want to fuse a that spicy roleplay LoRA to your favorite base language model?

Want it as easy as clicking a language model folder, a peft folder, a save directory and that LoRA or QLoRA is now fused to whatever base model?

This does that.

## But How I Do The Thing?

You run the one script in this repo in a python instance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer
- `transformers` library
- `torch` library
- `tkinter` library

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

3. Run the `easypeftgui.py` script:

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the required directories.

## Acknowledgements

This script is based on a command-line driven script TheBloke shared in [this Hugging Face forum](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/guanaco-65B-GPTQ/discussions/2)
I don't know how TheBloke does it. I swear that guy is everywhere.

## License

This project is licensed under nothing whatsoever. I don't get paid to do this.
Tools this easy should have been released with the release of PEFT as a common sense onramp. I see problem I fix problem.
